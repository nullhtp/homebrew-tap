  caveats <<~EOS
    One line finishes the install — where your essays live, whether esse waits
    at login, and which key brings it forward:

      /Applications/Esse.app/Contents/Resources/esse-setup

    Run it again any time to change an answer. Your writing is plain files in
    a folder you choose, and nothing here — install, upgrade or uninstall —
    touches it.

    This build is signed by its author, not notarised by Apple: paying a
    yearly developer subscription for an app with one writer is not the trade
    esse makes. Homebrew quarantines what it downloads and macOS refuses a
    quarantined app signed this way, so this cask clears that flag from the
    app it has just checksummed. The source it was built from is at
    github.com/nullhtp/esse, and `make install` builds your own copy instead.
